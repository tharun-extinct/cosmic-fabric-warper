You are working on a 2D Space-Time Physics Simulator - an interactive educational tool that visualizes gravitational physics in a 2D plane.

## Project Overview
This is a React-based web application using Three.js (via react-three-fiber) to create an immersive 2D physics simulation. The application allows users to create celestial bodies and observe their gravitational interactions in real-time.

## Key Features Implemented
1. **2D Physics Simulation**: All objects are constrained to a 2D plane (Y=0)
2. **Interactive Object Creation**: Press and hold to create objects, flick to add velocity
3. **Dynamic Space-Time Fabric**: White gradient fabric that appears during object creation and fades after 2 seconds
4. **Real-time Physics**: N-body gravitational simulation with collision detection
5. **Educational Tools**: Experiments, achievements, and analytics panels
6. **Visual Effects**: Orbital trails, velocity vectors, and selection indicators

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **3D Engine**: Three.js via react-three-fiber (R3F)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Physics**: Custom N-body physics engine

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ 2D view with top-down camera perspective
- ✅ Press and hold object creation with mass scaling
- ✅ Flick gesture for velocity assignment
- ✅ Dynamic space-time fabric with white gradient
- ✅ Fabric visibility during creation with auto-fade
- ✅ Real-time gravitational interactions
- ✅ Collision detection and merging
- ✅ Orbital trail visualization
- ✅ Properties panel for object inspection
- ✅ Settings panel for physics parameters
- ✅ Analytics panel for energy conservation
- ✅ Experiments and achievements system
- ✅ Export tools for screenshots and data

## Key Components
- `Scene3D.tsx`: Main 3D scene with camera and lighting
- `PhysicsObject.tsx`: Individual celestial body rendering
- `SpaceTimeFabric.tsx`: Dynamic fabric with gravitational wells
- `CreationTool.tsx`: Interactive object creation system
- `PhysicsEngine.ts`: N-body physics calculations
- `simulationStore.ts`: Global state management

## User Interaction Flow
1. Click the "+" button to enter creation mode
2. Press and hold on the canvas to create an object (longer hold = larger mass)
3. Drag while holding to set initial velocity vector
4. Release to finalize object creation
5. Watch objects interact gravitationally in real-time
6. Use panels to analyze physics and modify settings

The simulator provides an intuitive way to explore gravitational physics concepts through direct manipulation and real-time visualization.
